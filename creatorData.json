      "about": "Something about me is that I am an international student, and I came to the US when I was 17 years old. This was a hard but exciting experience for me. I needed to figure out everything by myself. There were many things that I didn't know about life which I learned when I came here and every day for me was a challenge and a new experience."

      "about": "An interesting fact about me is that I am part Cuban and Mexican from my parents side of the family although I was born in the United States. This has given me the opportunity to travel to many places with family within these countries and explore the culture, food, and atmosphere. I have been on a road trip all around Mexico already and stopped at one major destination at every state."
